## Stained-Glass-Window

Stained-Glass-Window is a design experiment inspired by a pixellated stained glass window from Cologne Cathedral made by Gerhard Richter. This project is currently on its first draft, and I am in the process of deciding how I would like to develop it further.

#### What

Three column grid-design. Each box of the grid is composed of hundreds of smaller divs that intermittently change colour in a random pattern. When any of the coloured boxes are clicked on, that colour is removed from the overall palette. When all the colours are removed, the user can click again and it refreshes to its initial state.

#### How

Currently this is done dynamically. The entirety of the grid is generated by javascript and then coloured (through assigning the individual divs a random colour class) from a pre-defined array of colours. A timer is set so that every 100ms it fills again randomly from the same array. When one of the boxes is clicked on, an event fires that removes that colour from the potential palette.

#### To do:

1. Some of the javascript was written in a rush and it needs significant refactoring.
2. I'd like to make it so that each of the sub-grids changes independently of the others (i.e. has its own event handler).
3. I'd consider adding something akin to a rose window at the top of the design, but would need to develop my CSS skills first before I could achieve this. 
4. You could make it longer so that you have to scroll to the bottom to see the entirety of the window.
5. Broken link and initial p element needs re-writing.
6. I am reconceiving this as an experimental web-comic idea. They're like flickering screens, works perfectly with some of the earlier themes of Eyes Without A Face. Could even add the I am sitting in a room soundtrack. Depending on the order of colour transitions could end with different panels, then its like you're reading in a multi-panel way. Destroy the linear aspect of reading... Ask Noga and Dor if they'd contribute art.
7. Rename the project and the title in the html.
-- Needs to be more responsive with smaller sizes.
-- Need to think the proportions through more, colour choices, colour proportions. Perhaps add even more boxes to make it more pixellated.

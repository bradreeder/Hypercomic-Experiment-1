## Hypercomic experiment 1

Stained-Glass is a design experiment originally inspired by a pixellated stained glass window made by [Gerhard Richter](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz4rky6FKd1qggdq1.jpg).

I am currently considering extending the basic design into an idea for a [hypercomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomics).

#### What

Three column grid-design. Each box of the grid is composed of hundreds of smaller divs that intermittently change colour in a random pattern. When any of the coloured boxes are clicked on, that colour is removed from the overall palette. When all the colours are removed, the user can click again and it refreshes to its initial state.

#### How

Currently this is done dynamically. The entirety of the grid is generated by javascript and then coloured (through assigning the individual divs a random colour class) from a pre-defined array of colours. A timer is set so that every 100ms it fills again randomly from the same array. When one of the boxes is clicked on, an event fires that removes that colour from the potential palette. When the colour array is empty it refreshes to its original condition.
